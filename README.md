# PolygonAC-BypassV2

- How to bypass?
1) Virtualize and run your steam with SandBoxie. SandBoxie will run our game as a system and no longer as our user, so the game cannot even access to external process.
3) We can simply drop our steam exe into the SandBoxie program and run it outside of our user and as an administrator.
4) What we need to do now is just open the game and use cheat engine normally, the game doesn't even detect the connected handles so we're fine.
